Welcome to my blog! I'm Emma (she/her). I have two cats named Aladdin and Luigi, and I'm a DevOps engineer by day. At heart, my first love has always been observational astronomy, however. I was an amateur astronomer when I was young and recently decided I'd give it another go.

I currently observe the night sky with a 10" Orion Intelliscope. It doesn't appear these are sold anymore, but it gave me a great foundation when I was younger. I hope to expand on this setup and eventually get into imaging with an SCT on a GEM in this [b]log (maybe next year!).
